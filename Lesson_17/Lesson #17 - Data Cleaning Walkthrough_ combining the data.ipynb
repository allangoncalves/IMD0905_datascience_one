    "In the last mission, we began investigating possible relationships between **SAT scores** and **demographic factors**. In order to do this, we acquired several data sets about [New York City public schools](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/data?cat=education). We manipulated these data sets, and found that we could combine them all using the **DBN** column. All of the data sets are currently stored as **keys** in the **data** dictionary. Each individual data set is a pandas dataframe.\n",

    "We'll need to condense these data sets so that each value in the **DBN** column is unique. If not, we'll run into issues when it comes time to combine the data sets.\n",

    "While the main data set we want to analyze, **sat_results**, has unique **DBN** values for every high school in New York City, other data sets aren't as clean. A single row in the **sat_results** data set may match multiple rows in the **class_size** data set, for example. This situation will create problems, because we don't know which of the multiple entries in the **class_size** data set we should combine with the single matching entry in **sat_results**. Here's a diagram that illustrates the problem:\n",

    "Before we merge our data, we'll need to decide on the merge strategy we want to use. We'll be using the pandas [pandas.DataFrame.merge()](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html) function, which supports four types of joins -- **left**, **right**, **inner**, and **outer**. Each of these join types dictates how pandas combines the rows.\n",

    "There may be **DBN** values that exist in one data set but not in another. This is partly because the data is from different years. Each data set also has inconsistencies in terms of how it was gathered. Human error (and other types of errors) may also play a role. Therefore, we may not find matches for the **DBN** values in **sat_results** in all of the other data sets, and other data sets may have **DBN** values that don't exist in **sat_results**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll merge two data sets at a time. For example, we'll merge **sat_results** and **hs_directory**, then merge the result with **ap_2010**, then merge the result of that with **class_size**. We'll continue combining data sets in this way until we've merged all of them. Afterwards, we'll have roughly the same number of rows, but each row will have columns from all of the data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The merge strategy we pick will affect the number of rows we end up with. Let's take a look at each strategy.\n",

    "With a **left merge**, we'd only use **DBN** values from the dataframe on the \"left\" of the merge. In this case, **sat_results** is on the left. Some of the DBNs in **sat_results** don't exist in **class_size**, though. The merge will handle this by assiging null values to the columns in **sat_results** that don't have corresponding data in **class_size.**\n",

Depending on the strategy we choose, we may preserve rows at the expense of having more missing column data, or minimize missing data at the expense of having fewer rows. Choosing a merge strategy is an important decision; it's worth thinking about your data carefully, and what trade-offs you're willing to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this project is concerned with determing demographic factors that correlate with SAT score, we'll want to preserve as many rows as possible from **sat_results** while minimizing null values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we may need to use different merge strategies with different data sets. Some of the data sets have a lot of missing **DBN** values. This makes a **left** join more appropriate, because we don't want to lose too many rows when we merge. If we did an **inner** join, we would lose the data for many high schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some data sets have **DBN** values that are almost identical to those in **sat_results**. Those data sets also have information we need to keep. Most of our analysis would be impossible if a significant number of rows was missing from **demographics**, for example. Therefore, we'll do an inner join to avoid missing data in these columns."
